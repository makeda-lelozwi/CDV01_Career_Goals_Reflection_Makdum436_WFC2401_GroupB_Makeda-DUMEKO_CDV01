- **Name: Makeda Lelo-zwi Dumeko**
- **Date: 5 March 2024**
- **Current Role/Position: Enrty-level Software Developer**
- **Field of Interest: Web development and JavaScript development**

### Part 1: Self-Assessment Reflection

1. **Skills Analysis**:
    
    - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Git, GitHub
    - I need to improve on Git, and JavaScript
    - I would like to have more exposure with different HTML tags
      
2. **Interests and Values**:
    
    - My key interests are creating interesting web pages and layouts
    - Some things that I value  in my working environment are freedom of movement in the space, prioritising social, physical and mental health, and diversity. 
      
### Part 2: Career Exploration Insights

1. **Industries and Roles Explored**:
    
    - I've mainly looked at intern and/or junior  JavaScript developer and web developer roles
    - The mian industries that interested me are advertising, entertainment, and transport   
      
2. **Alignment with Personal Profile**:
    
    - I think that advertisers always have to think outside the box to create visually appealing campaigns and posts. I believe that my interest in UI/UX will be further developed in            the advertising space. The same goes for entertainment and transport. Not only do they create interesting interfaces but their also introduce very interesting features that we           usually did not think we needed up until they introduced it. 
    - I only have one adveritising company in mind and I think I should look for more

### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    - Gain initial experience as a developer through an internship or graduate program
      - I will have to gain practical experience if I want to grow as a developer and internships as usually the best way to do so.
      - I would prefer this over becoming a freelancer because I have no knowledge of how an actual project works in a work-setting where people's time and money is on the line so I                 think an internship would provide that guidance. 
  
    - Gain more confidence in design and interacticity by creating side projects that highlight my design abilities.
      - I will want to keep working on my creativity if I want to distinguish myself as a creative in the industry

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    - Become a mid-senior level developer working on projects like Spotify's Wrapped or the new Oracle playlist that they launched. 
      - Spotify is one of those companies that really pushes themselves to create amazing UI/UX fo rtheir listeners. I would love to contribute to similar kinds of projects. 

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:
    
    - Internship/grad program:
      - Complete my studies at CodeSpace 
      - Focus on creating high-quality, clean code that is easy to read and understand
      - Network both online and in-person
      - Apply, apply, apply!
    - Any resources or support required:
      - LinkedIn
      - Recommendations
      - Practice technical interviews
     
    - Creating more personal projects:
      - contributing to open-source projects that fit my style
      - set aside time to create two projects a year (if not every 6 months)

      
2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:
    
    - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.
    - Additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed:
      - I think as a mid-senior level developer I would need to have a good understanding of backend technologies
      - I would need more work experience
      - I would need  to also further my studies in computer science, management, etc. 

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:
    
    - Potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals:
      - I may become discouraged if I struggle to find work in the area that interests me the most
      - I may be discouraged if I am struggling to retain the new information that I need to level-up my skills
      - There may be family/personal events that force me to dedicate elss time to coding
        
    - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges:
      - Building a supportive community will be vital in overcoming feelings of giving up and also in struggling to find work
      - Remembering to cultivate a life outside of work will help me to have a balance and to be okay with not spending my entire life in front of a screen
